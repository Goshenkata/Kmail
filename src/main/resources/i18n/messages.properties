aboutThisProject=About this project
aboutParagraph=This project is made by Georgi Kolev, for both educational purposes and as my senior high school project, It emulates an email service, users can send messages and files (up to 25MB) to each other, all data is persisted in a database. The application is secure, all passwords are hashed, user privileges have been thoroughly tested to assure that no user can access data which it shouldn't be able to (like the emails of other users, that would be... bad). This project is internationalised, having support for both English and Bulgarian, it automatically resolves the localization of the user when they visit for a first time, and remembers preferences too! The application also validates every user input on both the front and back end and gives appropriate feedback to the user, as well as other kinds of error-handling (no ugly whitelabel pages!).<br> The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/Goshenkata/Kmail/">here</a><br>
